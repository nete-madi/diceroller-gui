# diceroller_gui
Your favorite dice rolling simulator, now in a GUI format.

Supports all 7 standard RPG dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100.
For now, the program shows your resulting rolls in the shell. I recommend using IDLE for this.

A simple project to help me get my feet wet with Python and the Tkinter GUI library.
